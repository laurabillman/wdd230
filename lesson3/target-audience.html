            <p>Monica is a busy, 29 year old mother of two and has been married for five years. She earned her teaching degree from
                Weber State University when she was 23 and taught Kindergarten for two years before having children. Her hobbies are hiking, camping, 
                and painting in her spare time. She and her husband recently moved their family to Syracuse, Utah. She recently started up
                a preschool business from her new home to help bring in some extra income due to inflation. Being new to Syracuse, Monica
                needs help advertising for her business where she doesn't know many people in the community.</p>

            <p>Anthony is a 55 year old driven, entrepreneur who has owned a thriving, local bakery in Syracuse, Utah for over twenty-five years. He and his wife 
                are empty nesters and he loves photography and traveling. He plans to retire within the next five years 
                so he and his wife can travel more. He wants to look into donating baked goods at local charity fundraisers and other events to try to give back to
                the comunity before he sales his bakey in the next few years. He needs to find some resources and people to help collaborate in order to do this.</p>
